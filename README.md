# Signal Android for LPC [signal-server](https://github.com/LPC-language/signal-server)

This is a fork of Signal Android v6.20.6.  The following relevant modifications
have been made:

-   `app/build.gradle`, `app/src/main/res/raw/whisper.store`, `app/static-ips.gradle`  
    The server URLs have been set to `dworkin.nl` internal domains, and a
    `dworkin.nl` root certificate was added to the certificate store with
    Keystore Explorer.
-   `app/src/main/res/values/firebase_messaging.xml`  
    Updated to use the Firebase project `msgserver-cloud` for Firebase Cloud
    Messaging.
-   `app/build.gradle`  
    Server public params changed to a new value, generated by `signal-server`.
-   `libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/services/CdsiClient.java`, `libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/services/CdsiSocket.java`  
    Use a fake CDSI server built into `signal-server`.
